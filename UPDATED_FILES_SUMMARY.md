    $publicPath = public_path('storage/' . $this->cover_image_path);
    if (file_exists($publicPath)) {
        return asset('storage/' . $this->cover_image_path);
    }

    return Storage::disk('public')->url($this->cover_image_path);
}
```

## New Files Created

### 3. move_existing_cover_images.php
**Location:** `move_existing_cover_images.php`

**Purpose:** Script to move existing cover images from old location to new location

**Usage:**
```bash
php move_existing_cover_images.php
```

## What This Fixes

1. **Upload Path Issue:** Files now upload directly to `public/storage/magazines/covers/`
2. **URL Generation:** URLs now point to the correct location
3. **File Access:** Web server can now access uploaded cover images
4. **Backward Compatibility:** Still works with old files if they exist

## Deployment Steps

1. **Upload the modified files:**
   - `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/MagazineController.php`
   - `app/Models/Magazine.php`

2. **Run the migration script:**
   ```bash
   php move_existing_cover_images.php
   ```

3. **Test the functionality:**
   - Create a new magazine with cover image
   - Edit existing magazine with cover image
   - Check that URLs work correctly

## Expected Results

- New cover images will be stored in: `public/storage/magazines/covers/`
- URLs will work: `https://user.netonyou.com/storage/magazines/covers/filename.png`
- Existing cover images will be moved to the correct location
- No more 404 errors for cover images
